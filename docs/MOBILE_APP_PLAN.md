# CityLife Church Mobile App Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for building a mobile app for CityLife Church, leveraging the existing Laravel backend system.

## Recommended Approach: Laravel API + React Native

### Why This Approach?
1. **Leverage Existing Backend**: Use your current Laravel system as the API backend
2. **Cross-Platform**: One codebase for both iOS and Android
3. **Cost-Effective**: Single development effort for multiple platforms
4. **Native Performance**: React Native provides near-native performance
5. **Large Community**: Extensive documentation and community support

2. **Install required packages**:
   - Navigation (React Navigation)
   - HTTP client (Axios)
   - Authentication (AsyncStorage)
   - Media player (react-native-video)
   - Maps (react-native-maps)
   - Push notifications
   - Offline storage (SQLite)

### Required APIs to Implement
1. Authentication API
2. User Profile API
3. Sermons API
4. Events API
5. News API
6. Contact API
7. Youth Camping API
8. Push Notifications API

## Development Timeline

### Week 1-2: Backend API Development
- Install and configure Laravel Sanctum
- Create API routes and controllers
- Implement authentication endpoints
- Setup basic CRUD APIs for core features

### Week 3-4: React Native Setup
- Initialize React Native project
- Setup navigation structure
- Implement authentication flow
- Create basic UI components

### Week 5-8: Core Features Development
- Sermons and content management
- Events and calendar
- News and announcements
- User profile management

### Week 9-10: Testing & Deployment
- Testing on real devices
- App store preparation
- Beta testing with church members
- Production deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Laravel API development**
2. **Setup authentication system**
3. **Create basic API endpoints**
4. **Initialize React Native project**
5. **Build authentication flow**

## Files to Create/Modify

### Laravel Backend
- `routes/api.php` - API routes
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/` - API controllers
- `app/Http/Resources/` - API resources
- `config/sanctum.php` - API authentication
- Database migrations for API tokens

### React Native
- New React Native project structure
- Authentication components
- Navigation setup
- API service layer
- Push notification setup

## Budget Considerations

### Development Costs
- **Laravel API**: 2-3 weeks development
- **React Native App**: 6-8 weeks development
- **Testing & Deployment**: 1-2 weeks

### Ongoing Costs
- **App Store Fees**: $99/year (iOS), $25 one-time (Android)
- **Push Notification Service**: $0-50/month depending on usage
- **Backend Hosting**: Current hosting should suffice

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
   - Pros: Easier development, web-based
   - Cons: Limited native features, app store distribution challenges

2. **Native Development (Swift/Kotlin)**
   - Pros: Full native performance
   - Cons: Need separate iOS and Android teams, higher cost

3. **Flutter**
   - Pros: Cross-platform, good performance
   - Cons: Learning curve, smaller community than React Native

## Conclusion

The Laravel API + React Native approach provides the best balance of:
- Leveraging existing backend investment
- Cross-platform mobile development
- Cost-effectiveness
- Scalability and maintainability
- Access to native device features

This approach will allow CityLife Church to have a professional mobile presence while building on the solid foundation of the existing Laravel system.
