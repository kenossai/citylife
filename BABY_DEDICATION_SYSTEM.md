# Baby Dedication System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive baby dedication registration system has been implemented for the church website, providing a complete workflow from public registration to administrative management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Public Registration System
- **Information Page** (`/baby-dedication`) - Explains the dedication process and requirements
- **Registration Form** (`/baby-dedication/register`) - Comprehensive 6-section form
- **Success Page** - Confirmation with next steps
- **Member Verification** - Real-time API to verify membership status

### 2. Database Schema
- **Table**: `baby_dedications` with 50+ fields covering:
  - Baby information (name, DOB, gender, place of birth)
  - Father & Mother details (contact info, membership status)
  - Address and emergency contacts
  - Dedication preferences (date, service, special requests)
  - Church information (attendance history, faith commitment)
  - Administration fields (status, scheduling, notes)

### 3. Admin Management (Filament)
- **Dashboard Integration** - Baby Dedications appears in "Pastoral Care" section
- **Comprehensive Forms** - 6 collapsible sections matching public form
- **Table View** with columns:
  - Baby name, parents, DOB, age, service preference
  - Status badges (pending, approved, scheduled, completed, cancelled)
  - Scheduled date and application date
- **Workflow Actions**:
  - Approve pending applications
  - Schedule approved dedications
  - Edit all details
  - View full records
- **Filters**: Status, service preference, regular attendees
- **Navigation Badge**: Shows count of pending applications

### 4. Business Logic
- **Status Management**: 5-state workflow (pending → approved → scheduled → completed)
- **Calculated Fields**: Baby age, full names, member verification
- **Audit Logging**: All actions tracked with user/member attribution
- **GDPR Compliance**: Photography/video consent tracking
